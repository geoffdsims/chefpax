## 🔄 CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION STRATEGY

### **Stagger Your Sowing:**

Instead of sowing all sunflower on Monday, split it:
- **Monday:** 50% of sunflower capacity
- **Thursday:** 50% of sunflower capacity

**Result:** Harvests ready on both Friday AND Monday

### **Priority System:**

**URGENT (Complete Today):**
- HARVEST tasks (crops are ready NOW)
- PACK tasks (orders shipping today)

**HIGH (Complete by EOD):**
- SEED tasks (sowing window is today)
- Germination checks for blackout trays

**MEDIUM (Complete this week):**
- Light phase monitoring
- Routine maintenance

**LOW (Ongoing):**
- Cleaning
- Inventory checks
- Planning

---

## 📊 CAPACITY PLANNING

### **Maximum Weekly Output:**
Based on 5 tiers × capacity per tier:

**Core Line Products:**
- Can produce: ~50-60 trays 10×20/week
- Current target: ~45 trays/week (90% capacity utilization)

**Premium Products:**
- Can produce: ~15-20 trays 5×5/week
- Current target: ~10 trays/week (50% capacity - room for growth)

**Live Tray Focus:**
- 15-20 live trays/week for delivery
- Remaining production → cut microgreens for wholesale/restaurants

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Timing is Everything**
- Harvest windows are narrow (2-3 day window max)
- Late harvest = reduced quality
- Early harvest = poor yield
- **Use dashboard to stay on schedule!**

### **2. Environmental Control**
- Temperature: 70-78°F (varies by crop)
- Humidity: 85-95% during germination
- Light: 12-16 hours/day (varies by crop)
- **IoT sensors will automate monitoring when connected**

### **3. Water Management**
- High moisture crops (Tier 1-2): 25 min flood
- Moderate crops (Tier 3): 25 min flood
- Light moisture crops (Tier 4-5): 18-20 min flood
- **Never over-water basils or amaranth!**

### **4. Rack Tier Assignment**
**ALWAYS follow grow card tier recommendations:**
- Tier 1: Sunflower only
- Tier 2: Peas, Broccoli
- Tier 3: Radish, Mixes, Wasabi
- Tier 4: Lemon basil, Thai basil
- Tier 5: Dark Opal, Amaranth, Shiso

**Wrong tier = poor results or crop failure!**

---
