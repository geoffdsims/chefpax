## Automation Schedule (Optional)

You can set up automated notifications using **Vercel Cron Jobs** or **GitHub Actions**.

### Vercel Cron (Recommended)

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/production/check-ready-tasks",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/production/daily-summary",
      "schedule": "0 6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule Explanation:**
- `0 * * * *` = Every hour, check for ready tasks
- `0 6 * * *` = Every day at 6:00 AM, send daily summary

---

## Troubleshooting

### "webhook_url is invalid"
- Make sure you copied the entire URL
- Check for spaces or line breaks in the URL
- URL should start with `https://hooks.slack.com/`

### "channel_not_found"
- Make sure the channel exists in your workspace
- Channel names should start with `#`
- The app needs to be invited to private channels

### No notifications appearing
1. Check that `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. Check Slack channel permissions
4. Look for errors in Vercel logs

## MongoDB Atlas Setup

You already have MongoDB set up, but here's a quick reference:

**Current Connection String:**
```
mongodb+srv://chefpax-user:UZQTizsE3Abla1ZH@chefpax-app.3zblni9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=chefpax-app
```

This is already in your `.env.local` as:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://chefpax-user:UZQTizsE3Abla1ZH@chefpax-app.3zblni9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=chefpax-app
