## üìä Stage 5: Analytics, Forecasting & Back-Office

### **Goal:** Operate like a full-scale farm-to-table SaaS

### **Current Status: ‚è≥ 60% COMPLETE**

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Inventory tracking and health scores
- ‚úÖ Low stock alerts (email + SMS)
- ‚úÖ Production task analytics (dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Order history in MongoDB

**What's Planned:**

#### **TensorFlow.js ML Forecasting** ‚≠ê CHOSEN PLATFORM
**Why:** Free, no registration, runs in Node.js, train on your own data

**Use Case 1: Demand Forecasting**
```typescript
// Train model on historical orders:
const trainingData = {
  features: [dayOfWeek, weekOfYear, temperature, recentOrders, seasonality],
  labels: [actualDemandByProduct]
};

// Predict next week's demand:
const prediction = model.predict(nextWeekFeatures);
// Output: "Sow 6 trays Pea Shoots (predicted demand: 5.8 trays)"
```

**Use Case 2: Optimal Harvest Timing**
```typescript
// Use IoT sensor data + historical quality scores:
const optimalHarvestDay = model.predict({
  variety: 'sunflower',
  sowDate: '2025-10-14',
  temperatureHistory: iotSensorData.temp,
  humidityHistory: iotSensorData.humidity,
  lightHours: iotSensorData.lightTracking
});
// Output: "Harvest on Day 9.5 for peak quality"
```

**Use Case 3: Dynamic Pricing**
```typescript
// Adjust prices based on inventory, demand, competition:
const suggestedPrice = model.predict({
  currentStock: 3,
  historicalDemand: [5, 6, 4, 7, 5],
  daysTilExpiry: 5,
  competitorPrices: [30, 32, 28]
});
// Output: "Reduce to $28 to move inventory faster"
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Collect 30-60 days of order data
2. Train initial models using TensorFlow.js
3. Deploy models to `/api/ml/predict`
4. Integrate predictions into production dashboard
5. A/B test price optimization

**Cost:** $0 (open source, runs on existing infrastructure)

#### **Business Intelligence Dashboards**

**Subscription Metrics:**
```typescript
// Track automatically:
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Churn rate by cohort
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Subscription product mix
- Retention by delivery frequency
```

**Production KPIs:**
```typescript
// Grow cycle analytics:
- Average days seed-to-harvest by variety
- Capacity utilization by tier (Tier 1-5)
- On-time harvest rate
- Waste/failure rate by product
- Labor hours per tray
```

**Delivery Performance:**
```typescript
// Logistics metrics:
- On-time delivery rate
- Average delivery cost per order
- Delivery radius analysis
- Customer satisfaction by carrier
```

#### **Daily Ops Summary (Slack Bot)**
```typescript
// Auto-posted every morning at 8 AM:

## üîÅ Bonus: Chef Automation Channel (B2B Upsell)

### **Concept:** White-Label Supply Platform for Restaurants

**The Pitch:**
> "ChefPax isn't just microgreens - it's your automated supply platform. Restaurants get predictable deliveries, you get predictable revenue."

### **B2B Features:**

**1. Self-Service Portal**
```
Restaurant dashboard:
- Current subscription (3√ó Sunflower/week)
- Upcoming deliveries (calendar view)
- Usage analytics (trending up/down?)
- One-click modifications (pause, swap varieties)
- Invoice history
- Suggested reorder timing (ML-powered)
```

**2. Multi-Location Support**
```
Chain with 5 locations:
- Each location has own delivery schedule
- Centralized billing
- Volume discounts (20+ trays/week = 15% off)
- Single admin manages all locations
```

**3. Data Dashboards for Chefs**
```
Chef sees:
- Monthly usage trends ("You used 40% more Pea Shoots this month")
- Cost analysis ("Amaranth = $0.85/plate vs $1.50 retail")
- Seasonal recommendations ("Basil demand peaks in summer")
- Harvest freshness scores (IoT-validated)
```

**4. API Access (For Enterprise)**
```
Restaurant POS system integrates:

POST /api/restaurant/auto-order
{
  "restaurant_id": "chef-austin-123",
  "trigger": "inventory_low",
  "product": "PEA_LIVE_TRAY",
  "quantity": 2,
  "delivery": "next_available"
}

‚úÖ Order placed automatically when POS detects low stock
```

### **B2B Revenue Model:**

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Starter:** 5-10 trays/week = 5% discount
- **Professional:** 11-20 trays/week = 10% discount  
- **Enterprise:** 21+ trays/week = 15% discount + dedicated account manager

**Additional Revenue Streams:**
- White-label platform fee ($50/month for self-service portal)
- API access ($100/month for POS integration)
- Custom grow calendars ($200 setup)
- On-demand consulting ($150/hour for menu planning)

**Why Investors Care:**
- **Recurring revenue** (B2B subscriptions have 95%+ retention)
- **Scalable** (same automation, 100√ó the volume)
- **Network effects** (more restaurants = more data = better ML)
- **Platform play** (ChefPax becomes infrastructure, not just product)

## üí° This Is Where Real Valuation Comes From

**Current:** Microgreens business  
**Future:** Subscription supply platform

**Comparable Valuations:**
- **Imperfect Foods** (produce subscription): $700M valuation
- **Farmer's Fridge** (fresh food automation): $300M valuation
- **Freshly** (meal subscriptions): $1.5B acquisition
- **Misfit Market** (produce subscription): $2B valuation

**Your Differentiator:**
- **Live trays** (6-10 harvests vs single-use)
- **Grow-to-order** (zero waste model)
- **B2B automation platform** (not just DTC)
- **Full-stack automation** (order ‚Üí grow ‚Üí deliver)
- **IoT + ML integration** (data moat)

**Investor Story:**
> "ChefPax is building the Shopify of hyper-local produce. We started with microgreens in Austin, but the platform works for any perishable good with a grow cycle. Our automation handles subscriptions, grow scheduling, and delivery for multiple growers. As we add more farmers to the platform, our ML gets better at predicting demand and optimizing yields. This is produce-as-a-service meets platform economics."

**Path to Scale:**
1. **Month 1-6:** Perfect Austin operations (current)
2. **Month 7-12:** Add 10 restaurant B2B accounts
3. **Year 2:** License platform to 3 other microgreen growers
4. **Year 3:** Expand to other produce (mushrooms, herbs, edible flowers)
5. **Year 4:** National platform with 50+ growers
